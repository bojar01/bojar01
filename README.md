# Hi, I'm Bojar 👋
## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a junior developer with two years of experience, passionate about technology since I was fourteen. After years of exploring tech as a hobby, I decided to make it my career — and now I’m living the life I envisioned!

## 🔧 My Skills
I code in various languages, including JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, and Swift. I also work with several frameworks and tools like ReactJS, React Native, Laravel, WordPress, and Docker.

I have foundational skills in other frameworks and languages, such as Angular, Vue, and C, though they aren’t my primary focus right now.

## 🎓 Certifications
I hold certifications in:

- Full Stack Development
- Application Design and Development
- Coming soon: Management in Digital Solutions

## 🔎 Interests
I'm especially excited about artificial intelligence and always looking to improve my skills in coding and development. In the near future, I hope to contribute to open-source projects and even launch my own.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
